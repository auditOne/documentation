[**Elrond**](https://elrond.com/) is a blockchain-based platform built for speed, security and scalability, while maintaining low transaction fees.
The integrated smart contract execution engine built on WASM, supports the most popular programming languages used by developers.

Elrond distinguishes itself from other networks by employing two unique features:

 - **Adaptive State Sharding**
 - **Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS)**

### Adaptive State Sharding

Elrond is the only blockchain to implement 3 types of sharding simultaneously. A more detailed explanation can be found in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/arda_project/status/1483787637533986817?s=20)

### Secure Proof of Stake 

Secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism is used to select validating nodes to produce blocks within a shard rather than the entire network like with traditional PoS. They maintain high-level security by randomly shuffling nodes into other shards to prevent collusion.


### The EGLD (“Electronic Gold”) token 

EGLD governs the network through staking and serves as the medium of exchange between users and developers (who pay transaction fees to use the network), and validators (who get those fees as reward for the services they provide).

### The Elrond Team

Since the foundation by the brothers Beniamin and Lucian Mincu together with Lucian Todea , they have gathered a [highly-determined team](https://elrond.com/team/) of 24 experienced entrepreneurs, engineers and researchers as well as a strong advisory panel.

### Elronds sustainability

Elrond [claims that it has become carbon negative](https://coinquora.com/elrond-leads-sustainable-innovation-in-european-blockchain/) by offsetting more CO2 than its network accounts for. This is a revolutionary milestone to bringing sustainability to blockchain innovation.

***
With its **Adaptive State Sharding** and **Secure Proof of Stake** protocols, Elrond brings an exciting approach to blockchain scalability and sustainability, featuring unprecedented transaction speeds and throughput numbers. These are the right ingredients for a future-proof network.

As an experienced validator, we help to keep the Elrond network secure by running enterprise grade validator nodes. Our decentralised team of experts and automated monitoring tools ensure our infrastructure is up and running 24/7.

You can also contribute to the networks' security and earn rewards at the same time by staking your EGLD tokens!
